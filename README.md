Why Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
It is widely used in:
 -Web Development (Django, Flask)
 -Data Science and Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)
 -Automation and Scripting
 -Game Development (Pygame)
 -Python has a large community and extensive libraries, making it beginner-friendly.

*Understanding Python Syntax and Basics
 1. Python Syntax Rules
Indentation: Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code.
Whitespace: Python is sensitive to whitespace. Ensure consistent indentation to avoid errors. Ideally, use 4 spaces for indentation.
Statements: Each line of code is a statement. You can write multiple statements on one line using a semicolon (; ), but this is not recommended.
Comments:
1. Use # for single-line comments.
2. Use''' or """ for multi-line comments.

Variables and Data Types in Python:
*What are Variables?
Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated in a program. A variable is created when you assign a value to it using the = operator.
Example:
 name = "Alice"
 age = 25
 height = 5.6

*Variable Naming Rules
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. 
Variable names must start with a letter or underscore. 
Variable names are case-sensitive. 
Avoid using Python keywords as variable names (e.g., print, if, else)

*Best Practices  
Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
Use lowercase letters for variable names. 
Separate words using underscores for readability (e.g., first_name , total_amount ).
