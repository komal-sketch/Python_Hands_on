#break syntax in example

for i in range(0, 20):
    print(i)
    if i == 11:
      break

# continue syntax in example

for i in range(0, 20):
   if i == 11:
      continue   # it will skip the value 11 and will continue
   print(i)

# pass syntax in example

# pass is a placeholder that does nothing, it is required when syntax requires statement but no action needed.
